#' Pretty heatmaps
#' 
#' The package for drawing pretty heatmaps in R. The ordinary heatmap function in R has 
#' several drawbacks when it comes to producing publication quality heatmaps. It is hard 
#' to produce pictures with consistent text, cell and overall sizes. The function 
#' pheatmap tries to alleviate the problems by offering more fine grained control over 
#' heatmap dimensions and appearance.
